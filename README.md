## LDS U-Net Model
LDS U-Net is a lightweight version of U-Net that contains densely connected deptwise separable convolution followed by pointwise convolution, multiscale skip connec-tion, and selection gates. It is inspired by several salient features used in other models  such as  the  U-Net,  MultiResUNet,  and  Attention  U-Net. The architecture of the proposed network of Light-Convolution Dense Selection U-Net (LDS U-Net) is shown below.
